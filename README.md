PDL
===

Programmable Delay Logic


This project servers an example of using PDLs - Programmable Delay Logics into a design. In order to demonstrate the usage/working of the PDLs, it has been integrated with an ALU based PUF or in-short signals to PDL lines are fed from two adders.

Organisation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware - Contains verilog project code to be programmed onto the FPGA <br>
Software - Contains software tester that sends and collects data from the FPGA

Getting started
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A good place to get started is the Wiki of the project available at, https://github.com/praveendath92/PDL/wiki
