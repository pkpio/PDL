Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:1073 - This design has 3073 KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints specified
   and therefore, may take a very long time to process. If your design has
   unexpectedly long run times, please consider minimizing the number of
   KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints in your design or use the -ignore_keep_hierarchy
   command line switch to have them ignored by MAP.

Phase 7.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

.......
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <trigger> is placed at site <AJ7>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <trigger.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net puf1/i2<0> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     5 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   5
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      4,105 out of  69,120    5%
    Number used as logic:                    4,105 out of  69,120    5%
      Number using O6 output only:           4,105

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 4,105 out of  17,280   23%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,110
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,105 out of   4,110   99%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of   4,110    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of   4,110    0%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         6 out of     640    1%
