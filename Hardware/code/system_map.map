Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:1073 - This design has 3073 KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints specified
   and therefore, may take a very long time to process. If your design has
   unexpectedly long run times, please consider minimizing the number of
   KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints in your design or use the -ignore_keep_hierarchy
   command line switch to have them ignored by MAP.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
