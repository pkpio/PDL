WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net puf1/i2<0> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     1 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        257 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      257 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             257

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   258 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          258
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           257 out of     258   99%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of     258    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of     258    0%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         5 out of     640    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        5 out of       5  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.22

Peak Memory Usage:  555 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  32 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   28 secs
