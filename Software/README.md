Running software tester
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold shift and right click -> Open command prompt here.
Now type software_tester.exe in the command prompt to run it.
The tester will create/update a file named results after a successful execution.

Alternatively you may double click to run the tester but this is not recommend as any specific run time errors will go unnoticed.


Software tester details

This will query the PUF for 1000 executions. Should there be a need for changing any run parameters please refer to Software tester code.
It is assumed that when you are looking into the software tester code you have previous working knowledge with c++ and Microsoft SIRC.
